1. Interning
    1.1 What is Interning?
        1.1.1 multiple strings point at same instance
        1.1.2 intern pool in heap
    1.2 Why Interning?

    1.3 Implications:
        1.3.1 equals : compares only adrress
        1.3.2 Immuatbility
2. Immuatbility
    2.1 What is Immuatbility? 
        2.1.1 Reference is mutable
        2.1.2 Instance is immuatbile
    2.2 Why Immuatbility?
        2.2.1 Interning
        2.2.2 Change in One is reflected in other strings as well
    2.3 Implications:
        2.3.1 Lack of functions
        2.3.2 Performance Issues 
            //s = "hello";
            //s+= "world";
            // nya bna dega ye
